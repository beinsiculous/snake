//! Browser entry point: fetch all assets into the engine's VFS, then run
//! the exact same game `main.rs` runs natively.
//!
//! On wasm the `GameConfig` save-path strings are localStorage keys, so
//! achievements, high scores, and input bindings persist per the
//! `docs/WEB_SAVES.md` contract (`beinsiculous.games.snake.*` keys, values
//! byte-identical to the native save files; the site's achievement board
//! reads the same keys).
//!
//! With `--features editor` the same library builds a SECOND bundle, served at
//! `/playground/snake/`, that runs this game inside the engine's scene editor.
//! That bundle writes none of the `beinsiculous.games.snake.*` keys above — an
//! editor session must not record achievements, scores or bindings the site's
//! boards read — and keeps its camera and panel layout in a slot of its own.
